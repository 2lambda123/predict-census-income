# Predict Census Income

This is a collaborative predictive modeling project built on the [ballet framework](https://github.com/HDI-Project/ballet).

## Join the collaboration

Are you interested in joining the collaboration?

### Getting started

First, get acquainted with the Ballet framework if you are not yet familiar.

1. Look over the [Ballet Contributor Guide](https://hdi-project.github.io/ballet/contributor_guide.html)
2. Look over the [Ballet Feature Engineering Guide](https://hdi-project.github.io/ballet/feature_engineering_guide.html)

Once you have done so, you can check out the features that are currently part of this project, in the contributed features directory ([`src/predict_census_income/features/contrib`](src/predict_census_income/features/contrib)).

### Your task

**Your task is to create and submit one feature to the project.**

1. The easiest way to get started is to launch an interactive Jupyter Lab session to hack on this repository. You can read more about this development workflow [here](https://hdi-project.github.io/ballet/contributor_guide.html#cloud-feature-development-workflow).

2. Alternately, you can use your preferred tools and development environment to create and submit a feature from your own machine. You can read about the local development workflow [here](https://hdi-project.github.io/ballet/contributor_guide.html#local-feature-development-workflow).
